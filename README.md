## Description 

This application essentially queries from an API to retrieve random users (employees), allows for the sorting of the results alphabetically by nam on a click event, and allows for the filtering of names by letters inputted into the search form field. I made it really just to work further with ReactJS.

## Installation

You can see a deployment of the application [on Heroku at this link](https://djp-employee-tracker.herokuapp.com/), but if you'd like to install it and see it operating from your local computer, clone the repo here in Github. From the command line, run 'npm install', and then run 'npm start'. 



## Usage 

The app is not really designed to be 'used', but to show some simple ways that ReactJS works. However, to use it, simply click on the sort button in order to sort the employee results into alphabetical order, and click it again to reverse sort. Type a name or partial name into the search input in order to see any names that include that string you type.
